# nvim
<b>UPDATE:</b> Wanted to change up my nvim config.  Decided to use the [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) as a guide.

This is my first attempt at a Neovim configuration/setup.  This configuration was <b>HEAVILY</b> influenced by the Primeagen's excellent tutorial on Neovim configuration.  You should check his video out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE).  Another huge help were Craftzdog's (Devaslife) videos.  I referenced this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajmK0ZNcM4Q) quite a bit.

If I can stay determined to start using Vim as my code editing paradigm of choice, I assume this config will evolve.

## Pre-Reqs
- Neovim
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
- Lua Language Server
