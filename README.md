# nvim
This is my first attempt at a Neovim configuration/setup.  This configuration was <b>HEAVILY<b> influenced by the Primeagen's excellent tutorial on Neovim configuration.  You should check his video out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE).

If I can stay determined to start using Vim as my code editing paradigm of choice, I assume this config will evolve.

## Pre-Reqs
- Neovim
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep).
